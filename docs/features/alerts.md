With Datafold's alerts, you can quickly monitor the data flowing through your pipelines.

Turn any SQL query into an alert that emails or messages your team. Get faster incident response times with code-free alerts that are customizable to your data.

Datafold learns how your data works to adapt to the seasonality and trends in your data to create dynamic thresholds with anomaly detection. Adjust the sensitivity or add custom anomaly detection to optimize your signal-to-noise ratio.

Customize alert triggers and notifications so only the right people are informed. Subscribe to alerts through Slack, Email, PagerDuty, or custom webhooks.
