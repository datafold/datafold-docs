# Examples

## Command Line Examples
For each of the ðŸ’š implemented and thoroughly tested ðŸ’š databases, we'll provide examples of `data-diff` input code and outputs on various data structures and sizes. 

### Snowflake

#### Massive Data Set with Missing Row

[TODO Example to be added]

#### Smaller Data Set with Several Conflicting Values

[TODO add a few screenshots to break up this text]

In this example, we use the CLI to compare a small data set of organizations (in this case, pharmacies and groceries) that exists as the `COMPANIES` table in two schemas, `ANALYTICS` AND `ANALYTICS_DEV`, in the same database, `SNOWFLAKE_DB`. 

Recall the basic command line formula mentioned in TODO link to how to use

`data-diff DB1_URI TABLE1_NAME DB2_URI TABLE2_NAME [OPTIONS]`

We'll used `-k` to specify that the primary key is `org_id`, and `-c` to indicate that we'd also like to surface conflicts in the`amount` and `company_name` columns.

Note that `ANALYTICS` is the first data set in your command (`DB1_URI`), and `ANALYTICS_DEV` is the second data set in your command (`DB2_URI`). This will be important to remember when interpreting the results.

All other strings surrounded in `<>` carrots ðŸ¥• should be replaced with your information.

Looking at the command and the results below, we find:

- Walgreens, CVS, DuaneReade, and Albertsons are missing from `ANALYTICS_DEV` (the `-` indicates that the row is _missing_ from `DB2_URI`)
- Aldi is missing from `ANALYTICS` (the `+` indicates that it _appeared_ in `DB2_URI`)
- RiteAid is in both data sets, which is why it appears twice. But something else is wrong: the `amount` changed!
- All rows that match exactly are not printed out.

```
$ data-diff \
  "snowflake://YOUR_USERNAME:<your_password>@<YOUR_ACCOUNT>/SNOWFLAKE_DB/ANALYTICS?warehouse=<YOUR_WAREHOUSE>&role=<YOUR_ROLE>" COMPANIES \
  "snowflake://YOUR_USERNAME:<your_password>@<YOUR_ACCOUNT>/SNOWFLAKE_DB/ANALYTICS_DEV?warehouse=<YOUR_WAREHOUSE>&role=<YOUR_ROLE>" COMPANIES " COMPANIES \
  -k org_id \
  -c company_name -c amount

- 1, 5000.00, Walgreens
- 2, 9000.00, CVS
+ 3, 49900.00 Aldi
- 4, 710000.00, DuaneReade
- 5, 21000.00, RiteAid
+ 5, 2000.00, RiteAid
- 6, 0.00, Albertsons
```

### PostgreSQL

#### Massive Data Set with Missing Row

In this example, we use the CLI to compare 25M rows in PostgreSQL where the
right-hand table is missing single row with `id=12500048`:

```
$ data-diff \
    postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/database rating \
    postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/database rating_del1 \
    --bisection-threshold 100000 \ # for readability, try default first
    --bisection-factor 6 \ # for readability, try default first
    --update-column timestamp \
    --verbose

    # Consider running with --interactive the first time.
    # Runs `EXPLAIN` for you to verify the queries are using indexes.
    # --interactive

#### Smaller Data Set with Conflicting Values

In this example, we use the CLI to compare a smaller data set with one missing row (`where actor_id = 4`) as well as several conflicting values:
- `Ed` is misspelled as `Edd`. (Or is `Edd` misspelled as `Ed`? Hard to say!)
- `Ed`/`Edd` and `Nick` have conflicting `last_update` values.
- There's one more conlicting `first_name` spelling:  `Penelope` vs `Penelop`.

```
 $ data-diff \
  postgresql://user:password@localhost/database actor \
  postgresql://user:password@localhost/database actor2 \
  -k actor_id \
  -c first_name -c last_name -c last_update
- 1, 2013-05-26 14:47:57.620000, Penelope, Guiness
+ 1, 2013-05-26 14:47:57.620000, Penelop, Guiness
- 2, 2013-05-26 14:47:57.620000, Nick, Wahlberg
+ 2, 2022-10-10 13:36:12.435821, Nick, Wahlberg
- 3, 2013-05-26 14:47:57.620000, Ed, Chase
+ 3, 2022-10-10 13:31:28.214738, Edd, Chase
- 4, 2013-05-26 14:47:57.620000, Jennifer, Davis
